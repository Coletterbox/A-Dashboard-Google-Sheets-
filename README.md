# A Dashboard (Google Sheets)

---

### An example of a dashboard that uses Google Sheets
### (So I have a project that only uses public data, meaning I can freely show it)

---

- [ ] Decide on a public data set.\
      - https://www.api.gov.uk/gds/data-gov-uk \
      - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
- [ ] Write code that retrieves the data.\
      - Use JavaScript / Google Apps Script if I want to write the data directly to a Google Sheet.\
      - Use Python if the data set is small enough that I may as well just paste it in.
- [ ] Make dashboard in Google Sheets.
      - Link here and/or add screenshot.
